## Movie Dataset Analysis

### Summary

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about movies. The goal is to understand the relationships between different attributes and their impact on gross earnings.

### Key Findings

- **Highest Correlation**: Votes and budget exhibit the highest correlation with gross earnings. This suggests that movies with higher votes and larger budgets tend to have higher gross earnings.

- **Low Correlation**: Company has a low correlation with gross earnings. This implies that the production company behind a movie may not strongly influence its gross earnings.

### Methodology

- Data cleaning tasks were performed to handle missing values, convert data types, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

- Various visualization techniques, including scatter plots and correlation matrices, were used to explore relationships between variables.

- Correlation coefficients were computed using different methods (e.g., Pearson, Kendall) to quantify the strength of relationships between numeric variables.

### Conclusion

Understanding the factors that influence gross earnings in the movie industry is crucial for decision-making. By analyzing correlations between different attributes, we can gain insights that may help predict box office success and guide investment decisions.
